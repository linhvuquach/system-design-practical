Performance on the frontend is critical for user experience and retention. Here are some key areas to focus on to optimize frontend performance:

### 1. **Minimizing HTTP Requests**
- **Combine Files**: Merge CSS and JavaScript files to reduce the number of HTTP requests.
- **Image Sprites**: Use image sprites to combine multiple images into a single file.
- **Lazy Loading**: Load resources only when they are needed, especially images and videos.

### 2. **Optimizing Images**
- **Compression**: Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim to compress images without losing quality.
- **Responsive Images**: Use the `srcset` attribute to provide different image resolutions for different devices.
- **Formats**: Use modern image formats like WebP that offer better compression rates than traditional formats like JPEG or PNG.

### 3. **Efficient CSS and JavaScript**
- **Minification**: Remove unnecessary characters from CSS and JavaScript files to reduce file size.
- **Critical CSS**: Inline critical CSS needed for rendering above-the-fold content and defer the rest.
- **Code Splitting**: Break up JavaScript into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand.

### 4. **Browser Caching**
- **Cache-Control Headers**: Set appropriate caching headers to leverage browser caching for static resources.
- **Service Workers**: Use service workers to cache assets and enable offline functionality.

### 5. **Reducing Server Response Time**
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: Use a CDN to serve static resources from a location closer to the user.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Generate HTML on the server side to reduce the time it takes for the browser to render content.

### 6. **Optimizing Web Fonts**
- **Font Loading**: Use `font-display: swap` to ensure text remains visible during font loading.
- **Subset Fonts**: Include only the characters needed for your content to reduce font file size.

### 7. **Improving Perceived Performance**
- **Progressive Rendering**: Display parts of the content as soon as they are available.
- **Skeleton Screens**: Use placeholders to indicate that content is loading, which can improve the perceived speed.

### 8. **Performance Monitoring and Testing**
- **Tools**: Use tools like Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and PageSpeed Insights to analyze and monitor performance.
- **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**: Implement RUM to gather performance data from actual users and identify real-world issues.

### 9. **Asynchronous Loading**
- **Defer and Async**: Use `defer` and `async` attributes for non-essential JavaScript to avoid blocking page rendering.
- **Web Workers**: Use Web Workers to run scripts in the background without affecting the main thread.

### 10. **Optimizing Animations**
- **CSS Transitions and Animations**: Prefer CSS over JavaScript for animations, as CSS animations are typically more performant.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Use properties like `transform` and `opacity` to leverage GPU acceleration.

## Memory leaks
Memory leaks in the frontend occur when a web application retains memory that is no longer needed, causing the browser's memory usage to grow over time. This can lead to performance degradation, crashes, and a poor user experience. Identifying and preventing memory leaks is crucial for maintaining a performant frontend. Here are some common causes and strategies to manage memory leaks:

### Common Causes of Memory Leaks

1. **Uncleared Timers and Intervals**
   - **Issue**: `setInterval`, `setTimeout`, or `requestAnimationFrame` can cause memory leaks if not properly cleared.
   - **Solution**: Always clear timers and intervals using `clearInterval`, `clearTimeout`, or `cancelAnimationFrame` when they are no longer needed.

2. **Event Listeners**
   - **Issue**: Adding event listeners without removing them when they are no longer needed can lead to memory leaks.
   - **Solution**: Use `removeEventListener` to detach event listeners when components are unmounted or when the listeners are no longer required.

3. **Global Variables**
   - **Issue**: Excessive use of global variables can cause memory to be retained unnecessarily.
   - **Solution**: Minimize the use of global variables and prefer using local scope variables or modules.

4. **Closures**
   - **Issue**: Closures can unintentionally capture and retain references to variables, leading to memory leaks.
   - **Solution**: Be mindful of the scope of variables captured by closures and avoid holding references longer than necessary.

5. **Detached DOM Nodes**
   - **Issue**: References to DOM nodes that are no longer in the document can cause memory leaks.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that references to detached DOM nodes are removed and that nodes are properly cleaned up when they are no longer needed.

6. **Single-Page Applications (SPAs)**
   - **Issue**: SPAs can suffer from memory leaks due to components and state not being properly cleaned up on route changes.
   - **Solution**: Properly manage component lifecycle and state, and use libraries like React's `useEffect` cleanup function to clean up resources.

### Strategies to Prevent Memory Leaks

1. **Manual Cleanup**
   - Use cleanup functions to remove event listeners, clear timers, and nullify references when components are destroyed or when they are no longer needed.

2. **Weak References**
   - Use `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` for objects that should not prevent garbage collection if there are no other references to them.

3. **Profiling and Monitoring**
   - Use browser developer tools to monitor memory usage and identify potential leaks. Tools like Chrome DevTools can help you take heap snapshots and analyze memory allocation.

4. **Garbage Collection Awareness**
   - Understand how JavaScript garbage collection works. The garbage collector reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable. Ensuring that objects are dereferenced when they are no longer needed can help the garbage collector do its job.

5. **Component Lifecycle Methods (for frameworks)**
   - In frameworks like React, use lifecycle methods (such as `componentWillUnmount` or cleanup functions in `useEffect`) to release resources when a component is unmounted.

6. **Avoid Long-Lived References**
   - Avoid keeping long-lived references to objects, especially in global scope or singleton services, as these can prevent the garbage collector from freeing memory.
