In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), it's **generally not recommended** for an Aggregate Root to include another Aggregate Root directly. Here's why:

1. Aggregate boundaries: Each Aggregate Root defines a consistency boundary. Including one Aggregate Root within another would blur these boundaries and potentially lead to complex, tightly coupled designs.

2. Transactional consistency: Aggregates are designed to be transactionally consistent units. Having nested Aggregate Roots could make it challenging to maintain this consistency across multiple aggregates.

3. Identity and lifecycle: Each Aggregate Root has its own identity and lifecycle. Nesting them could create confusion about ownership and responsibility for managing the lifecycle of the nested Aggregate Root.

4. Complexity: Nested Aggregate Roots can quickly lead to a complex domain model that's difficult to understand and maintain.

Instead of directly including one Aggregate Root within another, there are better approaches:

1. Reference by ID: An Aggregate Root can hold a reference to another Aggregate Root's ID. This maintains a looser coupling between aggregates.

2. Domain Events: Use domain events to communicate changes between aggregates, allowing them to react to changes in other parts of the system without direct coupling.

3. Domain Services: When operations span multiple aggregates, you can use a domain service to coordinate the interaction.

4. Eventual Consistency: Accept that not all related data needs to be immediately consistent, and design your system to handle eventual consistency between aggregates.
